The people of Uzbekistan are known for their warm hospitality, and a respectful attitude towards local culture will enhance your experience. Dress modestly, especially when visiting religious sites, and always ask for permission before taking photos of people, particularly in rural areas. Itâ€™s also a good idea to learn a few basic phrases in Uzbek or Russian, as this will be greatly appreciated by locals and can help you navigate your way around more easily.",
	"tips-text-2": "Another important tip is to plan your finances accordingly, as Uzbekistan is largely a cash-based society. While major cities like Tashkent may have ATMs and accept credit cards at hotels and upscale restaurants, it's advisable to carry sufficient cash for smaller towns, markets, and local vendors. The local currency is the Uzbekistani Som, and exchanging money at official exchange points or banks is recommended for getting the best rates. Additionally, while tap water is generally safe in larger cities, it's advisable to drink bottled water during your travels to avoid any stomach upsets.",
